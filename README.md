# TPA_RE_Analysis
Statistical model using Zillow APIs to detect price drops in the real estate Tampa market.


#TDO for @estRelief 01/06/22: Next thing is for us to talk about branching strategy. Meaning, how you and I are going to collaborate (writing code) without stepping on each other's toes. See image: 3E84B7E6-D8FC-4BA4-8CA6-056E954C09A2.jpeg. I uploaded this file into the Main branch. This is where Git becomes essential.

For later: We are going to use visual studio code (vs code) as the IDE to write code. https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=osx - Install when you have time.
