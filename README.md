# Instructions for Brooke - Jan 3rd

OK Brooke. Github is a platofrm or a tool that developers use to manage code. Code is stored in a "folder" or "Directory" called Repository or Repo. Developers check out a copy of the code to make changes (add or update code). When done, they check in the code back into their main branch. A branch is a copy of the code and each copy can be named like "main", "Develop", "Brooke_copy", etc. This repo is called "TPA_RE_Analysis". The technology used by Github and other tools like this is called "Git". Try install Git in your laptop and watch one of these videos to get a high level tutorial.

#TODO: Was I supposed to use Git to type here? I watched both videos and downloaded Git and VS code. Definitely still a bit confused about Git but thinking it'll be more clear soon once I start using it? Also, when I installed Git, it gave me three apps: Git Bash, Git GUI, and Git Command Prompt. The first video said I should be using Git Bash but we are going to be using VS Code, right? And then pulling that into Git to add to save files and add to GitHub? 

For later: We are going to use visual studio code (vs code) as the IDE to write code. https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=osx - Install when you have time.
