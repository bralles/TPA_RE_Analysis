# TPA_RE_Analysis

# TODO for @estRelief 1/16: scan this page: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html. We are going to use venv to create a virtual python environment. This is used to package or contain all your files and dependencies. A Dependency is another application (API, package or module) that our program will need to run. You'll see an example soon.
