#TODO for @estRelief 01/14/22: After downloading VS Code, you should have in your laptop: VS Code, Python 3.x and Git. Next: 

1 - Open VS Code and install these extensions: Git and Python. We want to create a folder in our laptops and then using Git (the hard way so you can learn) we will clone this repo.
2 - Create a folder
3 - Open Git and navigate to the folder using the cd command (search how to do that to get to that folder you have created)
4 - Once in that folder, type: git clone https://github.com/bralles/TPA_RE_Analysis.git - This should download the repo and place it in a TPA_RE_Analysis folder.

You should now have a copy that is placed in version control. Now, lets go ahead and make a change to this file via vs code.

1 - Go to vs code
2 - File > Open Folder and search for the repo in your laptop
3 - vs code should now display the folder on the left side and underneath, this file (readme.md)
4 - Open this file
5 - Remove all these instructions and type: DONE! - Brooke ;)
6 - save file
7 - Go to Terminal > New Terminal. Click + to create a new bash terminal or powershell.
8 - Then type:
