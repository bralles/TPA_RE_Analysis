# Instructions for Brooke - Jan 3rd

OK Brooke. Github is a platofrm or a tool that developers use to manage code. Code is stored in a "folder" or "Directory" called Repository or Repo. Developers check out a copy of the code to make changes (add or update code). When done, they check in the code back into their main branch. A branch is a copy of the code and each copy can be named like "main", "Develop", "Brooke_copy", etc. The technology used by Github and other tools like this is called "Git". Try install Git in your laptop and watch one of these videos to get a high level tutorial.
