# COVID_Analysis
Statistical model using COVID-19 APIs to analyze covid trends in the past 30 days and upcoming 30 days to determine if cases are decreasing.

COVID-19 API: https://rapidapi.com/Gramzivi/api/covid-19-data

We are going to use RAPID API. I have an account. But, you dont have to worry about  signing up.

You need to install the package: Requests

pip install requests

Make sure you dont mistype "requests". Hackers have found that if you mistype the package name, it will download whatever you type which could be a virus or malicious package being installed.

From Brooke: I updated this to be current to the new project. You can change it how you like. I just didn't want it to talk about Zillow anymore.
