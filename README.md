We are going to use RAPID API. I have an account. But, you dont have to worry about  signing up.

You need to install the package: Requests

pip install requests

Make sure you dont mistype "requests". Hackers have found that if you mistype the package name, it will download whatever you type which could be a virus or malicious package being installed.
