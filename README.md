# TPA_RE_Analysis
Statistical model using Zillow APIs to detect price drops in the real estate Tampa market.

# TODO for @estRelief 1/16: scan this page: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html. We are going to use venv to create a virtual python environment. This is used to package or contain all your files and dependencies. A Dependency is another application (API, package or module) that our program will need to run. You'll see an example soon.

I already created the virtual environment on my laptop. I named it re_venv. It created a folder/dir where our dependencies will be stored. Everytime you use vscode to work here, you need to type on a powershell terminal (in vs code): re_venv\Scripts\activate. This will activate the environment. If it doesnt (you would see at the command line this: (re_venv)), then google how to activate venv on a windows machine.

I didnt add this new directory to version control because you and I are using diferent operating systems, so go ahead and create a venv. Call it the same: re_venv. Dont add it to version control.

Next, type pip list
This will show you all programs/dependencies installed in your re_venv. There should be only pip and setuptools. You may have to upgrade pip. If it says that, follow the instructions.
